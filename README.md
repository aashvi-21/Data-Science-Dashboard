# Data-Science-Dashboard

The purpose of this dashboard is to make it easy for fellow readers to find a book to read based on the number of pages and genre. Upon selecting a range of pages and/or genre, the table and graph show books within these two selected categories.

For the preparation of this dashboard, the following steps were taken:

1. Data cleaning to narrow down the genres and deal with missing values.
2. Coding to develop the front end of the dashboard, that is, the headings, graph, table, dropdown panels.
3. Creating callback functions to make the dashboard functional.
